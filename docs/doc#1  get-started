Purpose
 - Quick introduction to run and develop the Dorky core service and language clients.

Architecture (high level)
 - Core: a small language-agnostic HTTP service that implements artifact storage, streaming upload/download, metadata, idempotency and versioning.
 - Clients: lightweight language clients (currently `npm` and planned `pypi`) that call the HTTP service or the CLI.

Run locally (developer flow)
 - Start the service (from the repo root) using the Node runtime configured for this project (see docs/doc#3 the-correct-node-version): use Node 16.x for local development.
 - Example commands (use `nvm` or your preferred Node manager):

```bash
nvm use 16
npm install
npm run start
```

 - Install and run a language client from this repo (or call the HTTP API directly):

```bash
# from repo root (example)
cd web-app
npm install
npm run start
```

Developer notes
 - CI currently runs on Node 16 (publish workflow). Devcontainer image targets Node 18 — this will be aligned in a follow-up (see docs/doc#3 the-correct-node-version).
 - If you are building clients in Python, see `docs/doc#2.5 python-port` for design and publishing guidance.
