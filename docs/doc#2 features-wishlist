###this document highlights the features and vision for dorky as they come-up 

### these are based on using dorky and my own observations purely 

- this project is great it can be intialized as a seperate folder keeping project repo sanitary and avoid spilling artifacts into github remote which is the reason we have this in first place

- amazing part is that it is bring your own bucket (BYOB) making the whole process easy to try out and use 
at work as you can own the storage easily, it feels like rolling our own git

- it has dev (commit), stage and push which is a great and familar workflow almost all devs are familiar with 
asking them to add a commit message can build developer discipline too

- but it is severly limited in its ability to organise the documnets they exist in a flat heiarchy on the bucket/data lake we need a sync function to create, store and retrieve documents in a heirchial file structure

- it is only good for people who are using AWS/gcp  in thier stack, azure can be added too

- it is an purely npm package while it can easily be used in other environments especially pypi (im biased to use it in my python projects)

- as a data engineer i cant help but notice that the job of submitting files doesn't incorporate any compresssion eg a big json say 10 Mb could be converted to compressed json and converted back on retrieval, think parquet from csvs which are a headache since i need to regularly share them as fact tables in readable format from logs

- we can use 2*num_cores -1 number of thread to compress and use some concurreny while uploading artifacts

- can we think of how to fetch correct amount of deatils for some files say only a specific variable from and env

- can we incrementally update the file instead of uploading and fetching it as a whole

- the files themselves could use some metadata and check to avoid race conditions as well keep a clean record of changes for time travel eg: think of last updated time and checks to see if file was updated to raise merge conflicts

- uploads could be idempotent 

- optinally can we configure our bucket from dorky itself 

- select to encrypt or obfustcate selected files
